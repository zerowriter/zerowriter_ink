To install a firmware bin from SD card:

find the "firmware.bin" you want
place on SD card in root directory
insert SD card to Zerowriter Ink
Turn on (or reboot) Zerowriter Ink
Automatically will install

If your update fails, or it keeps rebooting, it means you need to proceed with a manual restore/update first. 
This will enable you to do SD card updates in the future.

To do the manual restore/update, visit this page:
