To install a firmware bin from SD card:

rename the file to "firmware.bin"
place on SD card
insert SD card to Zerowriter Ink
Turn on (or reboot) Zerowriter Ink
Automatically will install

If your update fails, or it keeps rebooting, it means you need to proceed with a manual restore/update first. 
This will enable you to do SD card updates in the future.

To do the manual restore/update, visit this page:
