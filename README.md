# zerowriter_ink

General repo for all things Zerowriter Ink.

Note that the current public firmware is 1.1. If you are using a factory Zerowriter Ink, you may experience some bugs.

For those field testing or using new units, consider opening an issue if you find bugs. You can do that here: (https://github.com/zerowriter/zerowriter_ink/issues)

This repo will be updated with the source code, documentation, and design files for ZW Ink.

Also consider sharing your custom fonts (.bbf), layouts (layout.json), and other tools you may find helpful.
